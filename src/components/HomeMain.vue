    Hello, my name is Oscar.
  </h5>
  <div class="card-body">
    I study Computer Science at Tec de Monterrey. I have extensive
    experience in web development and systems infrastructure.
    Throughout my career I've won multiple hackathons, interned at
    large companies like <router-link to="/experiences">Google and Lyft</router-link>, and designed systems
    from scratch.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My most common and proficient stack is MERN with GraphQL. I can
    comfortably work with Javascript, Python, and C++.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have a strong interest for web3 and cryptography. I believe the
    future of web technologies is secured by core mathematical
    concepts.
